# DevOps Project â€“ CI/CD Pipeline for Web Application

This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline built using Jenkins to automate the deployment, testing, and monitoring of a web application on Apache Tomcat. 
The pipeline includes several Jenkins jobs that sequentially trigger each other to handle tasks such as polling the GitHub repository for updates, deploying changes, checking server uptime, performing automated testing with Selenium, and conducting load and stress tests using Gatling.

## Project Overview

- **Application**: A simple web application deployed on Apache Tomcat with a text input field.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Built with Jenkins, consisting of five main jobs.
- **Monitoring**: Server availability monitored using UptimeRobot.
- **Automated Testing**: Functional tests automated with Selenium IDE.
- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress tests conducted using Gatling.

## Pipeline Workflow

The pipeline is structured to poll the GitHub repository every minute, detect changes, and automatically deploy updates. Once an update is deployed, each Jenkins job sequentially triggers the next, initiating server availability monitoring, automated functional tests, and load and stress testing. Below is an overview of each job and its role within the pipeline.

### Jobs Descriptions

1. **poll-and-deploy**
   - **Purpose**: This job polls the GitHub repository for changes every minute. If there are changes, it pulls the updated code and deploys it to Apache Tomcat.
   - **Configuration**:
     - **Repository URL**: [https://github.com/ShayShuve123/DevOps_WebApp.git](https://github.com/ShayShuve123/DevOps_WebApp.git)
     - **Trigger**: Poll SCM set to `* * * * *` (every minute).
     - **Build Steps**: Executes shell command to copy files from the `$WORKSPACE` directory to the Tomcat webapps directory.
   - **Shell Command**:
     ```bash
     cp -r $WORKSPACE/* /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/devops_project
     ```
   - **Outcome**: Ensures that the latest code is always deployed to the web application automatically.

2. **uptime-monitor**
   - **Purpose**: Monitors the availability of the web application using UptimeRobot. Checks server status every five minutes.
   - **Configuration**:
     - **Build Steps**: Uses `curl` to call the UptimeRobot API, verifying the server status.
   - **Shell Command**:
     ```bash
     response=$(curl -s -X POST 'https://api.uptimerobot.com/v2/getMonitors' \
     -d 'api_key=your_api_key&format=json')
     status=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.monitors[0].status')
     if [ "$status" -eq 2 ]; then
       echo "Server is up."
     else
       exit 1
     fi
     ```
   - **Trigger**: Executes `selenium-test` job only if the server is available.

3. **selenium-test**
   - **Purpose**: Runs automated functional tests on the web application using Selenium IDE. Checks if specific elements and functionalities work as expected.
   - **Configuration**:
     - **Build Steps**: Executes a Selenium `.side` file to simulate user actions.
   - **Shell Command**:
     ```bash
     export NVM_DIR="/home/deftera/.nvm"
     [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
     tempfile=$(mktemp) && \
     /home/deftera/.nvm/versions/node/v22.9.0/bin/selenium-side-runner --server http://localhost:4444 -c "browserName=firefox" /home/deftera/devops.side > "$tempfile" && \
     if grep -q "Finished test Test1 Success" "$tempfile"; then
       echo "Test finished successfully.";
     else
       exit 1;
     fi && \
     rm "$tempfile"
     ```
   - **Trigger**: Triggers `gatling-load` job if tests pass successfully.

4. **gatling-load**
     
  The load test graph illustrates a gradual increase in the number of concurrent users on the server, reaching up to 90% of its maximum capacity. From there, we 
  maintain the number of concurrent users at this percentage (90%) for 4 minutes to assess how the system functions under load. Near the end, we gradually reduce 
  the number of simultaneous users to 0 and finish the test.

Note: This test is based on the assumption that the limit is 100 concurrent users; therefore, we ramp it up to 90 concurrent users.

5. **gatling-stress**

  The load test graph illustrates a gradual increase in the number of concurrent users on the server, reaching up to 90% of its maximum capacity. From there, we 
  maintain this load for 4 minutes during which, three times, we briefly increase the number of simultaneous users to 110 percent of the server's maximum capacity 
  before returning to 90 percent. This process aims to assess the system's functionality after subjecting it to an unexpected load. Near the end, we gradually 
  reduce the number of simultaneous users to 0 and finish the test.

   Demonstrates updating the code locally (changing "Text" to "text"), committing to GitHub, and triggering the CI/CD pipeline.
   Shows the automatic deployment of the updated text on the web application, as well as the uptime monitoring, automated testing, and load/stress test results.
