DevOps Project â€“ CI/CD Pipeline for Web Application
This project demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline built using Jenkins to automate the deployment, testing, and monitoring of a web application on Apache Tomcat. The pipeline includes several Jenkins jobs that sequentially trigger each other to handle various tasks such as polling the GitHub repository for updates, deploying changes, checking server uptime, performing automated testing with Selenium, and conducting load and stress tests using Gatling.

Project Overview
Application: A simple web application deployed on Apache Tomcat with a text input field.
CI/CD Pipeline: Built with Jenkins, consisting of five main jobs.
Monitoring: Server availability monitored using UptimeRobot.
Automated Testing: Functional tests automated with Selenium IDE.
Performance Testing: Load and stress tests conducted using Gatling.
Pipeline Workflow
The pipeline is structured to poll the GitHub repository every minute, detect changes, and automatically deploy updates. Once the update is deployed, the system monitors availability, runs automated tests, and performs load and stress tests. Below is an overview of each job and its function within the pipeline.

Job Descriptions
poll-and-deploy

Purpose: This job polls the GitHub repository for changes every minute. If there are changes, it pulls the updated code and deploys it to Apache Tomcat.
Configuration:
Repository URL: https://github.com/ShayShuve123/DevOps_WebApp.git
Trigger: Poll SCM set to * * * * * (every minute).
Build Steps: Executes shell command to copy files from the $WORKSPACE directory to the Tomcat webapps directory.
Shell Command:
bash
Copy code
cp -r $WORKSPACE/* /var/lib/tomcat8/webapps/devops_project
Outcome: Ensures that the latest code is always deployed to the web application automatically.
uptime-monitor

Purpose: Monitors the availability of the web application using UptimeRobot. Checks server status every five minutes.
Configuration:
Build Steps: Uses curl to call the UptimeRobot API, verifying the server status.
Shell Command:
bash
Copy code
response=$(curl -s -X POST 'https://api.uptimerobot.com/v2/getMonitors' \
-d 'api_key=your_api_key&format=json')
status=$(echo "$response" | jq -r '.monitors[0].status')
if [ "$status" -eq 2 ]; then
  echo "Server is up."
else
  exit 1
fi
Trigger: Executes selenium-test job only if the server is available.
selenium-test

Purpose: Runs automated functional tests on the web application using Selenium IDE. Checks if specific elements and functionalities work as expected.
Configuration:
Build Steps: Executes a Selenium .side file to simulate user actions.
Shell Command:
bash
Copy code
export NVM_DIR="/home/deftera/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
tempfile=$(mktemp) && \
/home/deftera/.nvm/versions/node/v22.9.0/bin/selenium-side-runner --server http://localhost:4444 -c "browserName=firefox" /home/deftera/devops.side > "$tempfile" && \
if grep -q "Finished test Test1 Success" "$tempfile"; then
  echo "Test finished successfully.";
else
  exit 1;
fi && \
rm "$tempfile"
Trigger: Triggers gatling-load job if tests pass successfully.
gatling-load

Purpose: Conducts a load test to simulate up to 90% of the system's maximum capacity.
Description: Gradually increases the number of concurrent users to 90%, maintaining the load for four minutes to observe system behavior.
Result: Assesses application performance under expected load conditions.
gatling-stress

Purpose: Conducts a stress test by increasing load to 110% of the maximum capacity intermittently.
Description: Maintains the load at 90% capacity but briefly spikes to 110% three times to assess system resilience.
Result: Identifies application limits and behavior under unexpected, intense load conditions.
Demonstration
Video 1: Pipeline Overview
Demonstrates the sequential execution of Jenkins jobs within the pipeline, showing each job being triggered automatically after the previous one completes.

Video 2: Code Update and Deployment
Demonstrates updating the code locally (changing "Text" to "text"), committing to GitHub, and triggering the CI/CD pipeline. Shows the automatic deployment of the updated text on the web application, as well as the uptime monitoring, automated testing, and load/stress test results.
